  <p>This UI will allow you generate new Anki decks based on your goals, while biasing vocab in cards testing grammar and whole-sentence cards toward words you already know.</p>

  <p>The data contained in this app takes advantage of several publically available data sources:
  	<ul>
  		<li><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4176592/">Zipf</a></li>
  		<li><a href="https://omwn.org/">Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW)</a></li>
  	</ul>
  	As well as cards generated by LLM to test specific aspects of grammar and idiomatic translation (thanks Dave).
  </p>
  <p>
  	This UI will also allow you to leverage the LLM for yourself- generating decks based on either:
  	<ul>
  		<li>Algorithm-selected categories you are weak on</li>
  		<li>Specific aspects of grammar you choose to focus on</li>
  		<li>.txt files in Spanish you submit that can be tokenized, translated, deck-ified to be made sharable between all of us</li>
  	</ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  	There are decks I have created and audited myself, which are also available for download here. Such as primer decks for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Nuestra-parte-Spanish-Mariana-Enriquez/dp/8433998854"><i>Nuestra Parte de Noche</i></a> a book I have been reading, and episodes of <a href="https://pluto.tv/us/on-demand/series/66df633b4d30430013a88a50/season/8"><i>Acapulco Shore</i></a> which we have been watching together.
  </p>
  <p>There is content available for download from this app whether or not you upload your own data, but to learn how to leverage your progress and use the LLM to make new cards, let's go to <a href="http://localhost:8000/ui/getting-started.html">Getting Started</a>.</p>
